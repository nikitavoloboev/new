        Below are some of my favorite quotes that I love. Starting with my
        favorite quote of all by Alan Watts.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had
          a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end,
          success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we
          missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you
          were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played.
        </p>

      <p>
        If you don&#39;t know Alan Watts, I recommend you{" "}

          Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything
          around you that you call life was made up by people that were no
          smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can
          build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that,
          you&#39;ll never be the same again.

          Psychedelic experience is only a glimpse of genuine mystical insight,
          but a glimpse which can be matured and deepened by the various ways of
          meditation in which drugs are no longer necessary or useful. If you
          get the message, hang up the phone. For psychedelic drugs are simply
          instruments, like microscopes, telescopes, and telephones. The
          biologist does not sit with eye permanently glued to the microscope,
          he goes away and works on what he has seen...

          Arguing that you don&#39;t care about the right to privacy because you
          have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don&#39;t care
          about free speech because you have nothing to say.

          The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new
          semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise.
        </p>

          If you want to teach someone why to use an abstraction, you should

          My whole system of life is keeping at it. The task of life is not to

        <p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p>
        <p>An unexamined life is not worth living.</p>
        <p>You can’t be free if you judge people.</p>

        <p>Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone.</p>
        <p>
          Humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself
          less.

        <p>The only way to protect a good idea is superior execution.</p>

          For a long time it seemed to me that real life was about to begin, but
          there was always some obstacle in the way. Something had to be got
          through first, some unfinished business; time still to be served, a
          debt to be paid. Then life would begin. At last it dawned on me that
          these obstacles were my life.

          There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True

          It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary

          Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow know

          Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how
          they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn&#39;t
          really do it. They just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after
          a while.

          When you&#39;re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers,
          you&#39;re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even
          though it faces the wall and nobody will see it. You&#39;ll know
          it&#39;s there, so you&#39;re going to use a beautiful piece of wood
          on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the
          quality, has to be carried all the way through.

          Only the shaman knows that culture is a game. Everyone else takes it

          Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while one is
          peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes.

          A programmer will be able to understand a problem in full only when he
          has solved it at least once.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present
          in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state.
          Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it
          against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every
          once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he
          do it? He must be a genius!”

          It’s dark because you are trying too hard. Lightly child, lightly.
          Learn to do everything lightly. Yes, feel lightly even though you’re
          feeling deeply. Just lightly let things happen and lightly cope with
          them. So throw away your baggage and go forward. There are quicksands
          all about you, sucking at your feet, trying to suck you down into fear
          and self-pity and despair. That’s why you must walk so lightly.
          Lightly my darling...

          The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious
          and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if
          it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          A person who thinks all the time has nothing to think about except
          thoughts. So he loses touch with reality, and lives in a world of
          illusion.

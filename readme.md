# New

All starters as repos have `new-` prefix and can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev?tab=repositories&q=new-). Repos that don't end with `-test` are ones I actually use as starters.

Repos in use with `new-` prefix:

- [files](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/new-files) - New files
- [snippets](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/new-snippets) - New snippets

- [web-auth](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/new-web-auth) - New website with auth (TanStack Start, Jazz, Clerk)

# New

> New snippets, files, projects

All starters as repos have `new-` prefix and can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev?tab=repositories&q=new-). Repos that don't end with `-test` are ones I actually use as starters.

[new-files](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/new-files) & [new-snippets](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/new-snippets) are used by me often too.
